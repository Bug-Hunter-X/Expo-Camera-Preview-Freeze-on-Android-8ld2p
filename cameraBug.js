This bug occurs when using the Expo Camera API with certain Android devices.  The camera preview may freeze or fail to render correctly. This is often linked to issues with the camera permissions,  the device's camera hardware, or incompatibility with specific Android versions or devices. The error messages are inconsistent and may not always pinpoint the exact problem, making debugging difficult.  Sometimes no error message is presented.
